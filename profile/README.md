[_**GitHub Copilot**_](https://www.github.com/features/copilot/) :robot: is an AI-powered coding assistant that is aimed at generating code for developers and learners alike. It allows you to write better code faster by providing contextual suggestions directly in your integrated development environment (IDE). Let's delve deeper into using this productivity-boosting tool. :rocket:

## What is GitHub Copilot? :bulb:

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI-based coding assistant that was developed collaboratively by OpenAI and GitHub. As a tool powered by machine learning, GitHub Copilot can automatically suggest whole lines or blocks of code as you type, enabling you to write coding programs faster.

Here are some of the core features and benefits:

- It provides code auto-completion, thereby saving you from typing out the whole line of code.
- It quickly learns from your coding style and gives suggestions based on context to help you develop and innovate quickly.
- GitHub Copilot supports several languages like Python, C, C++, JavaScript, among others. But its functionality is not limited to these languages alone; it supports almost all languages on GitHub.
- It is not mandatory for your code to be present on GitHub. GitHub Copilot can assist you whether your repo is on GitHub or not.
- GitHub Copilot can integrate with numerous IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, JetBrains IDEs, and Azure Data Studio.

Rest assured, GitHub Copilot is not just a dumb code generator; it can understand your comments to provide more contextually accurate suggestions. 

## GitHub Copilot - When to Use? :thinking:

With its extensive range of usage, GitHub Copilot can be your go-to solution for the following tasks:

- **Code Auto Completion**: GitHub Copilot can write out a line of code, a function, or even an entire class for you. This auto-completion feature is beneficial when coding under strict deadlines or when you're struggling to remember the correct syntax.
- **Quick Learning**: GitHub Copilot's code suggestions can help you learn a new language by showing how to write a function or a statement in the new language.
- **Code Comments**: With the '/explain' command, you can ask GitHub Copilot what a certain function does. It'll provide a quick explanation that can be used for inline documentation or just your understanding.
- **SQL Query**: It can also help develop SQL queries based on the table and field names you enter.
- **Contextual code suggestions**: GitHub Copilot understands the context of your code - what it does and what it's supposed to do. This understanding helps GitHub Copilot provide accurate suggestions.
