## This access provisioning process is only for NetApp IT employees (Under Umesh Manathkar's org)
If you are part of engineering, please follow the steps here - [https://confluence.ngage.netapp.com/display/NGAGE/Copilot](https://confluence.ngage.netapp.com/display/NGAGE/Copilot)

[_**GitHub Copilot**_](https://www.github.com/features/copilot/) :robot: is an AI-powered coding assistant that is aimed at generating code for developers and learners alike. It allows you to write better code faster by providing contextual suggestions directly in your integrated development environment (IDE). Let's delve deeper into using this productivity-boosting tool. :rocket:

## What is GitHub Copilot? :bulb:

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI-based coding assistant that was developed collaboratively by OpenAI and GitHub. As a tool powered by machine learning, GitHub Copilot can automatically suggest whole lines or blocks of code as you type, enabling you to write coding programs faster.

Here are some of the core features and benefits:

- It provides code auto-completion, thereby saving you from typing out the whole line of code.
- It quickly learns from your coding style and gives suggestions based on context to help you develop and innovate quickly.
- GitHub Copilot supports almost all languages on GitHub.
- It is not mandatory for your code to be present on GitHub. GitHub Copilot can assist you whether your repo is on GitHub or not.

Rest assured, GitHub Copilot is not just a dumb code generator; it can understand your comments to provide more contextually accurate suggestions.

## Using GitHub Copilot - Commands :rainbow:

GitHub Copilot Chat is an interactive interface that allows you to communicate with GitHub Copilot directly from a supported IDE. It enables you to pose coding-related queries and receive responses instantly, eliminating the need to sift through documentation or browse online forums for answers. It's a convenient tool that brings coding assistance and information right to your workspace.

Here are a few slash commands that you can use and what they do:

- `'/explain'`: When a function is highlighted and you type this command in the chat window, Copilot will explain what the function does.
- `'/fix'`: If you highlight a function and explain the bug you are encountering, Copilot will provide a solution to fix the issue.
- `'/tests'`: By highlighting a function and typing this command, you can ask Copilot to generate a unit test for that function. 
- `'/new'`: You can type a few sentences on what you want to create, and GitHub Copilot will either create the project or explain how to create it.
