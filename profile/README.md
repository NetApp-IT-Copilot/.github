[_**GitHub Copilot**_](https://www.github.com/features/copilot/) :robot: is an AI-powered coding assistant that is aimed at generating code for developers and learners alike. It allows you to write better code faster by providing contextual suggestions directly in your integrated development environment (IDE). Let's delve deeper into using this productivity-boosting tool. :rocket:

## What is GitHub Copilot? :bulb:

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI-based coding assistant that was developed collaboratively by OpenAI and GitHub. As a tool powered by machine learning, GitHub Copilot can automatically suggest whole lines or blocks of code as you type, enabling you to write coding programs faster.

Here are some of the core features and benefits:

- It provides code auto-completion, thereby saving you from typing out the whole line of code.
- It quickly learns from your coding style and gives suggestions based on context to help you develop and innovate quickly.
- GitHub Copilot supports several languages like Python, C, C++, JavaScript, among others. But its functionality is not limited to these languages alone; it supports almost all languages on GitHub.
- It is not mandatory for your code to be present on GitHub. GitHub Copilot can assist you whether your repo is on GitHub or not.
- GitHub Copilot can integrate with numerous IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, JetBrains IDEs, and Azure Data Studio.

Rest assured, GitHub Copilot is not just a dumb code generator; it can understand your comments to provide more contextually accurate suggestions. 

## GitHub Copilot - When to Use? :thinking:

With its extensive range of usage, GitHub Copilot can be your go-to solution for the following tasks:

- **Code Auto Completion**: GitHub Copilot can write out a line of code, a function, or even an entire class for you. This auto-completion feature is beneficial when coding under strict deadlines or when you're struggling to remember the correct syntax.
- **Quick Learning**: GitHub Copilot's code suggestions can help you learn a new language by showing how to write a function or a statement in the new language.
- **Code Comments**: With the '/explain' command, you can ask GitHub Copilot what a certain function does. It'll provide a quick explanation that can be used for inline documentation or just your understanding.
- **SQL Query**: It can also help develop SQL queries based on the table and field names you enter.
- **Contextual code suggestions**: GitHub Copilot understands the context of your code - what it does and what it's supposed to do. This understanding helps GitHub Copilot provide accurate suggestions.

## How to Access GitHub Copilot? :key:

The process differs a bit for existing Copilot users and new users.

### For Existing Copilot Users:

- **VS Code users**: Follow this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide) to get GitHub Copilot on your VS Code.
- **JetBean users**: Currently, the plugin is still in beta and shouldn't be installed yet.

### New User Registration for NetApp IT: 
**Coming Soon** - Notification will be sent on new user boarding poronce once we are ready!


## Using GitHub Copilot - Commands :rainbow:

GitHub Copilot is unique because it allows you to interact with your coding assistant using the chat feature. This chat feature provides numerous commands that you can execute to perform various tasks. Additionally, the responses from Copilot can help you understand your code better.

Here are a few slash commands that you can use and what they do:

- `'/explain'`: When a function is highlighted and you type this command in the chat window, Copilot will explain what the function does.
- `'/fix'`: If you highlight a function and explain the bug you are encountering, Copilot will provide a solution to fix the issue.
- `'/tests'`: By highlighting a function and typing this command, you can ask Copilot to generate a unit test for that function. 
- `'/new'`: You can type a few sentences on what you want to create, and GitHub Copilot will either create the project or explain how to create it.

## Users' Review :loudspeaker:

Don't just take our word for it, read what others who have been using GitHub Copilot have to say:

#### Jason Shu

`"Just wanted to say copilot has saved me literal hundreds of hours of coding. I was admittedly shocked to see only only 10-15 licenses are being used. As someone who is super obsessive about productivity (keyboard shortcuts for everything, macapps, extensions, you name it), copilot is so essential to my workflow (i'd pay much more than $20 for it tbh). especially when i'm going back between perl and python."`

#### Charles Yu

`"Positive experience overall. Co-pilot is great for creating common utility functions. It can provide the basic functionality quickly. Co-pilot can write good unit tests and is especially helpful in filling certain structures and speeding up development."`

#### Gavin Hardin

`"Positive experience (time savings, mostly good suggestions). Integration into the IDE eliminates context switching/keeps you in the "flow". It is a low effort tool and no workflow changes needed."`
